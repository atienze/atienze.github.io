                <p>
                 Constant change has made me into who I am today but without my experiences in hobbies such as sports, gaming, and reading. I wouldn't be who I am today. I am in my first year at Western Washington University but am classified as a sophomore through my previous education at Edmonds Community College. I still do find love in sports as I try to play in recreational leagues for fin and exercise. I have also become very interested in the back-end process of how computers work. This interest will be fulfilled here at western as I am a pre-major in Computer Science.

                <h2>Professional</h2>
                <p>My professional life doesn't equate to much because of how young I am but I do find possible interests in professions. For example I am planning to be a Computer Science major which would put me into professions involving some sort of software development. Though I also find extreme interest in photography which is also shown on this website. Ive always found love in taking a picture that perfectly captures the essence of emotion that I feel at the time of the picture. Though I wouldn't be as interested if I hadn't taken a photography class at <a href="https://www.mukilteoschools.org">Kamiak High School</a>.

This School taught me very good Time management and gave me college credits.

                <p> As said in my professional description, Ive always loved to capture moments that have sentimental value to me. All these pictures above represent a point in time that meant something to me. Through photography I feel as if these experiences that ive had can be frozen in time and captured using a simple photo.
